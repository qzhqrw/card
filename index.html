                    Stop letting the opinions of others control your life. Its not what others think that is important, its what you think
                    about yourself that matters. You are the expert on your life and need to do what is best for you. What is best for you
                    is not necessary what is best for others, and that is OK. Give up feeling shame about past failures. All things will be good!

                    We must not only act, but also dream - The only way to make great things happen is by being a doer. Putting in the work.
                    One step at a time. Making sure that today is better than yesterday. And never stop dreaming and striving to reach new
                    heights. Working on my dream is what gets me excited to wake up every morning and seize the day.
